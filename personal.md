<p>When not working on research, I enjoy training for triathlons. My favorite thing about triathlons is that swimming, running, and biking provide a nice variety of workouts and a great way to enjoy the outdoors. I also love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0CWYISXO8k">playing classical music</a> on the piano and regularly assist with music at my <a href="https://knoxannarbor.org/">church</a>. I am married to the lovely Jeanna Welch.</p>
